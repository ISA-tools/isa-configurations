##What are ISA configurations

ISA Configurations consist of multiple XML files and are created in the ISAcreator configurator, the latest version is downloadable from the ISA GitHub site (https://github.com/ISA-tools/ISAconfigurator/downloads) or from the main ISA website (http://www.isa-tools.org).

The configurations are designed to meet the requirements of one or more checklist(s) ( [http://www.mibbi.org minimum information), specifying the required fields, and/or enabling values to be drawn from a set of ontology terms.

##Download configurations

All available configurations produced by the ISA tools team and collaborators (ISA commons, http://isacommons.org/) can be viewed via a table at the dedicated ISA-tools Configuration File page
(http://www.isa-tools.org/format/configurations/)

Some configurations are also available at:
